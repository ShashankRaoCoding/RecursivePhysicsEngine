# RecursivePhysics 

This is a simple physics engine I wrote in Python for use with Pygame game development. I wrote this to use in my own videogame development, but figured it might be of use to some new developers who are just getting started. The initialisation section has parameters that can be tweaked and adjusted for various jump heights, gravity, and to even convert the experience from a 2D-sidescroller to a 2D-top down game. 

The code structure is highly modular to allow users the greatest freedom. Comments shall hopefully be added to the RecursivePhysics.py file soon, though minimal comments are already present to allow those who wish to get started to do so. 

By default, all objects are drawn as rects. This can be modified to draw images to the screen. 

The front-end is handled by Pygame, and thus pygame is a necessary dependency not included here. You can get pygame here: https://github.com/pygame/pygame or type in 
     pip install pygame      
in your command line.
